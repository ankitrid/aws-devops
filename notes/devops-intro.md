# DevOps Introduction - Week 1 Notes

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). The goal is to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously.

## Key DevOps Concepts

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automate merging code changes frequently.
- **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):** Automate deploying applications.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Manage infrastructure using code (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation).
- **Configuration Management:** Automate software configuration (e.g., Ansible, Chef).
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Keep track of system health (e.g., Prometheus, CloudWatch).

## Benefits of DevOps

- Faster software delivery
- Improved collaboration between teams
- Higher quality and reliability
- Better scalability and security

## DevOps Lifecycle
